KDE Image I/O library.

This library allows applications that use the Qt library to read and
write images in extra formats. Current formats include:

JPEG	<read>
XV	<read> <write>
EPS	<read>
NETPBM	<incomplete>

To use these formats, you must 

1. link the application with the libkimgio library
2. Include the <kimgio.h> header
3. call kimgioRegister() once, somewhere in your code
   before you load an image.
