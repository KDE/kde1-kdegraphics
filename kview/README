kview 0.10
----------

Yet another tentative release of kview, the KDE image viewer.

kview extends QImageIO with publicly available image-handler libraries. 

To be more honest with my kview development, I've been using kview instead
of xv whenever possible; this gives me a first-hand impression of what it
needs and what it lacks.

Do drop me a line if you get it running or not.  (taj@kde.org)

HOW TO GET
----------

Source:

ftp://ftp.ph.unimelb.edu.au/incoming/taj/kde/ will have the latest version 
of kview and the graphics libraries it requires.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Edit the Makefile. Comment out any format declarations if you don't
   have those libraries.

2. Make sure the environment variables QTDIR and KDEDIR are set

3. make dep; make

4. make install

Libraries Required
------------------

Format: GIF
Library(version): giflib, compiled to shared lib.
Where: http://www.ccil.org/~esr/home.html

Format: JPEG, PNG
Library: libgr (built and tested with 2.0.9-2.0.11)
Where: sunsite

SINCE 0.9
---------

Fixed resize and Makefile bugs


WHAT'S BEEN ADDED SINCE 0.7
---------------------------

* Some redesign of the UI
* Multiple windows
* URL support via KFM
* Drag and drop support (drop only)
* Now a KApplication
* Basic PNG support, very incomplete.
	- no dithering yet, so it'll look awful on 8-bit displays
	- transparent images may not work at all
* DOC++ source documentation, for those who care. (v 3.0 or above of DOC++)
* A poor excuse for a web page (spawns KDEHelp)
* cleaned up the Makefile a bit

How to add formats
------------------

0. Tell me you're working on the format to avoid duplicate work.
1. Create an image handler conforming to QImageIO::defineIOHandler
2. Add format header to formats.h
3. Add format QImageIO definition in formats.cpp
4. Add your source file and object file to the Makefile
5. Send me your source file and header!


TODO
----

* PNG is getting there. Targa and tiff are a possibility.
* Print
* Some sort of toolbar? I dont know... it might just be a waste of
  desktop real estate.
* There are still bugs, of course.
* Tentative... save support?
