kview 0.11.2
------------

Yet another tentative release of kview, the KDE image viewer.

kview extends QImageIO with publicly available image-handler libraries. 

To be more honest with my kview development, I've been using kview instead
of xv whenever possible; this gives me a first-hand impression of what it
needs and what it lacks.

HOW TO GET
----------

Available in the 'kdeapps' package. e.g.
     ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/distribution/tgz
     or any mirror of this site



INSTALLATION
------------

Follow the instructions for installing the kdeapps package, 
that is
           ./configure; make; make install

Image Formats:
--------------

JPEG: (Taj)  
- read support only

GIF:  (Taj)
- read support only
- realized by giflib 2.3 (waiting for Qt 1.3)

EPS:  (Dirk Schoenberg, schoenberger@signsoft.com)
- read support only

PCX, ILBM, TGA: (Dirk Schoenberg)
- reading only

XPM, XBM, BMP: provided by Qt 1.2
- read and
- write support

How to add formats
------------------

0. Tell me (Taj, Martin) you're working on the format to avoid duplicate work.
1. Create an image handler conforming to QImageIO::defineIOHandler
2. Add format header to formats.h
3. Add format QImageIO definition in formats.cpp
4. Add your source file and object file to the Makefile
5. Send me your source file and header!
