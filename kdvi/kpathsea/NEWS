This file records noteworthy changes.

2.6 (9 January 1995)
* MakeTeXPK installed from kpathsea, instead of each driver.
* MakeTeXPK.site looked for in texmf/web2c, instead of texmf/dvips.
* texmf.cnf installed and looked for in texmf/web2c, instead of texmf.
* If a mode is not explicitly specified, search all subdirectories (this
  was actually in a previous release).
* install-sh only looked for in the top-level directory.
* kpsewhich replaces and generalizes kpsexpand.

2.5 (15 December 1994)
* Go back to calling db_insert after a successful MakeTeXPK, and check
  for lack of an ls-R.
* Handle case of magstep -.5 for MakeTeXPK properly.

2.4 (28 October 1994)
* Avoid calling db_insert, which caused a segmentation fault.

2.3 (26 October 1994)
* Extra :'s in an envvar value, referring to the texmf.cnf value, work.
* Names like dpi600/cmr10.pk can be found in ls-R.
* KPATHSEA_DEBUG environment variable checked.
* Directories like pk/ljfour directly under $TEXMF/fonts are found.
* New standalone program, kpsexpand, optionally compiled and installed,
  to do variable expansion (not path searching).
* Debugging output written to stderr instead of stdout.
* pxlNNN support removed; I never intended to support `pxl1500', and
  pxl300 is never used.

2.2 (14 October 1994)
* MakeTeXPK invoked for the any_glyph type; this is for xdvik.
* MakeTeXPK sources $(psheaderdir)/MakeTeXPK.site if it exists.
* pxlNNN/cmr10.pk searched for (as well as dpiNNN/cmr10.pk and cmr10.NNNpk)

2.1 (12 September 1994)
* Manual goes through TeX, and .cps/.aux files are in the distribution.
* INSTALL* variables set at the top level.
* Dependency on GNU tr making paths.h and texmf.sed (->texmf.cnf) removed.
* texmf.cnf installed if it didn't previously exist.

2.0 (8 September 1994)
* Runtime configuration file support; see the manual.
* Both dpi600/cmr10.pk and cmr10.600pk are searched for.
* ls-R matches $TEXMF//latex2e vs. $TEXMF//latex209.
* $TEXMFLOG, if set, specifies a filename for logging successful searches.
* All directory entries beginning with `.' are ignored, not just `.' and `..'.
* Default path for PK and GF fonts includes the mode name.
* ls-R is in $TEXMFROOT instead of hardwired at compile time.
* More debugging flags, and they can be set with client program options.
* If MakeTeX{PK,TFM} fail, or aren't invoked, a file missfont.log is
  written with the requisite commands, as in dvips.
* More 328/329/330 fixes, maybe for the last time.
* The override font paths (XDVIFONTS etc.) apply only to glyph (PK/GF)
  searches, not TFM or VF.
* -g is not the default when linking, to avoid unnecessarily large binaries
  (due to static libraries) under Linux.
* configure checks for a smart putenv.
* Stat results are cached to speed up disk searches.

1.8 (2 April 1994)
* New target install-info, so the documentation can be installed without
  the headers.
* Existing but unreadable files are complained about, instead of just ignored.
* A leading %% in a path element forbids searching the disk for that
  element; only a db will be searched (if it exists).
* The db is only used if it might be relevant to a given path element,
  not searched first regardless.

1.7 (1 March 1994)
* Searches can use an externally-built ls-R ``database'', for speed.
* `VPATH = .' lines removed from generated Makefile, for broken Sun make.
* A path foo//tfm finds foo/tfm as well as foo/*/tfm.

1.6 (3 February 1994)
* Memory fault in copying long paths fixed.
* More variables passed down from the top-level Makefile.
* Mention SMART_PUTENV in the INSTALL file, and fix bug in xputenv.c
  when one envvar is a proper prefix of another.
* More attempts at eliminating magstephalf annoyances.
* Directory name substitutions are done globally when creating paths.h.
* Various changes for DOS.

1.5 (24 January 1994)
* Default paths changed.
* Defining GCC_WCHAR lets GCC define wchar_t.
* EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS defined in all cases (if they're not already).
* str[r]chr never redefined (I hope).

1.4 (3 November 1993)
* Check closest fallback font size.
* All default paths (including dvips') in paths.h.in, not the Makefile.
* Rearrange directory lists so that dirs in which a file is found
  migrate to the top.
* Update for Autoconf 1.7.

1.3 (6 October 1993)
* Fix free of non-malloced memory bug.
* Fix uninitialized gf path bug.
* mkdirchain invoked as an absolute filename.

1.2 (27 September 1993)
* Running MakeTeXPK is tried before the fallback resolutions.
* The final bitmap name uses a variable spec, so DOS & OS/2 can get
  dpi300/cmr10.pk.
* Document TeX-specific features.
* Dpi passed to MakeTeXPK via the envvar KPATHSEA_DPI instead of MAKETEX_DPI.

1.1 (26 August 1993)
* Installation fixes.

1.0 (5 August 1993)
* Routines to look up TeX font files, default path specifications, etc.
* Sort-of pattern matching: /foo//bar matches subdirectories
  /foo/a/bar, /foo/b/bar, /foo/a1/a2/bar, etc.
* $var and ${var} expansion.
* Support for MakeTeX... scripts.
* Support for fallback resolutions and font.
* Lazy evaluation of path elements.
* Some runtime debugging support.

0.2 (12 May 1993)

First general release as a standalone library.
