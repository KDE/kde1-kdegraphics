This directory contains the Kpathsea[rch] library, which implements
generic path searching, configuration, and TeX-specific file searching.

See `Makefile.in' for the version number.
See `NEWS' for changes by release.
See `INSTALL' for installation instructions.
See `CONFIGURE' for details on running Autoconf-generated configure scripts.
See `PROJECTS' for future improvements.

Please report bugs to tex-k@cs.umb.edu. 
(Email tex-k-request@cs.umb.edu with a line containing
    subscribe you@preferred.email.address
in the body of the message to join this mailing list.)

Suggestions for improvements in either the library or the documentation,
no matter how small, are welcome.

Installing this package will create the library and header files in
subdirectories of /usr/local (by default). Typically this library is not
installed, however; only the programs that use it are.

This is free software.  See the files COPYING* for copying permissions.
The top-level headers are `pathsearch.h' for the generic path searching
support, and `tex-{file,glyph}.h' for the TeX-specific support.
