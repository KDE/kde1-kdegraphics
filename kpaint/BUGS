This file lists known bugs in KPaint 0.1
========================================

KPaint aborts with a bad window error when displaying modal dialogs a second
time under kwm 0.4.4, this does not occur with fvwm95-2. I think this is a bug
in kwm.

Gets confused if right button is pressed whilst drawing, ie. with the left
button pressed too. (This may be related to my XFree86 ChordMiddle setting)

The tool properties dialog may show problems with qt-1.1 as it forgets to give
a repaint event when show is called for a dialog. I've added a fix for now,
but you should upgrade to Qt 1.2 when it is released. If you are using Qt 1.2
beta 3 or greater you can add -DNEWQT to the compiler defines to remove the
fix.
