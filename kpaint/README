                           KPaint - Help Contents
                                      
   
   
   KPaint is a simple bitmap paint program. KPaint is currently _alpha_
   quality software (ie. I make no promises that it won't crash and
   therby ruin your life, or at least your image). There is of course _no
   warranty_ as this is free software. For details of the license see the
   file LICENSE in the distribution. KPaint is part of the KDE Desktop
   Environment look on [1]www.kde.org for more information.
   
   KPaint requires version 1.2 of the Qt library from Troll Tech and
   libkde available from [2]ftp.kde.org.
   
   If you have any suggestions or bug reports my mail address is
   [3]moorer@cs.man.ac.uk, please mention kpaint in the subject line of
   your message. More general dicussions about KDE should take place on
   the KDE mailing lists (link). If you are reporting bugs then please
   provide as much information as possible (including a stack trace if
   possible).
   
   Currently there is no documentation but I'm starting to work on that,
   I've included an [4]outline of how the help should look.
   Differences from kpaint version 0.1
   
  What's changed?
  
   
   
   I've made a lot of internal changes in this release to make kpaint
   more of a kde application. The code is also now much cleaner and the
   basic framework is now all present. The visible changes are:
     * toolbar to select the current tool
     * a palette editor
     * kpaint now uses KKeyconf to handle key bindings
     * Gif write support and transparency support
     * No more hard coded paths
     * Multiple instance support
     * A spraycan
       
   
   
  What works?
  
   
   
   This is the second release of kpaint and things are getting better,
   see my [5]todo list for information about what is still to be
   implemented. The currently implemented features are:
   
     * Load and Save standard Qt formats (xpm, bmp etc.)
     * Load and Save gif images (with transparency support)
     * Load only jpeg
     * Circles, Ellipses, Freehand Pen, Rectangles, Lines, Spray Can
     * Zoom in and out
     * Tool properties
     * Palette Editor
     * Key configuration (under construction)
       
   Longer term plans are in the file PLANS in the source distribution
   
  Planned features
  
   
   
   This is my todo list roughly in order of priority:
   
     * Picture in picture mode for icons
     * Some more tools.
     * Area selections and cut and paste.
     * Image map generation.
     * User interface improvements.
     * Network file access.
     * File write support to more formats.
     * Better help.
