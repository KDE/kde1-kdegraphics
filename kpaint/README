   KPaint is a simple bitmap paint program. KPaint is currently ALPHA
   quality software (ie. it will probably crash). There is of course NO
   WARRANTY as this is free software. For details of the license see
   the file LICENSE. KPaint is part of the KDE Desktop Environment.

   If you have any suggestions or bug reports my mail address is
   moorer@cs.man.ac.uk, please mention kpaint in the subject line of
   your message. More general dicussions about KDE should take place on
   the KDE mailing lists.
   
  What works?
  
   This is the first release of kpaint and there's a lot missing, see my
   todo list for information about what is still to be implemented.
   The currently implemented features are:
   
     * Load and Save standard Qt formats (xpm, bmp etc.)
     * Load (only) kview formats (gif, jpeg)
     * Circles
     * Ellipses
     * Pen, Rectangle, Line
     * Some tool properties (fill etc.)
     * KDisplay dynamic user interface configuration
       
  Planned features
  
   This is my todo list roughly in order of priority:
   
     * Some more tools.
     * Network file access.
     * Area selections and cut and paste.
     * Image map generation.
     * File write support to gif.
     * Transparency support.
     * User interface improvements.
	 * More file formats.
     * Better help.
