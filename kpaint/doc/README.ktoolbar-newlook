I've taken the new look toolbar from kghostview 3.1 and added it to KWidget
1.0 . The changed files (KToolbar.cpp and KToolbar.h) are included in the
tar (availible from http://manatee.cs.man.ac.uk/~moorer/kde ) .
BEWARE I have not tested this on anything except the development code
of kpaint so your milage may vary. A screen shot is available on the same
page as the tar file.
