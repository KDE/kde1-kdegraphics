As always I am resting on the shoulders of giants. I am deeply indebted to 
Frank D. Cringle who wrote the excellent fax viewer viewfax on which 
KFax is partially based:

viewfax version 2.3, Copyright (C) 1990, 1995 Frank D. Cringle.

As well as the wonderful libtiff library version 2.3 beta:

And last but not least: Thanks to the Trolls for Qt. http://www.troll.no
