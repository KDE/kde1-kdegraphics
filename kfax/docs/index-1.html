<P>KFax is a Fax file viewer capable of displaying and printing all common fax file formats.
In particular the fax files used by popular the mgetty/sendfax and hylafx fax send and
receive packages can be displayed. The first (or only) page of a "PC-Research"-style 
(DigiFAX) files produced  by  the ghostscript dfaxhigh or dfaxlow drivers can
also be displayed. (who is still using this format?) Input files using any 
common fax encoding such as group  3 (1 and 2 dimensional) 
and group 4 can be displayed. KFax has built in native postscript printing
capabilities.</P>
