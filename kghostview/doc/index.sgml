<sect>Introduction

<p>

KGhostview is the PostScript viewer for the K Desktop Environment. It is a
port of Tim Theisen's Ghostview program which is used to view documents
prepared in <bf/Adobe/'s PostScript page description language. PostScript is
the major page description language for printing on UNIX systems and this
application is used to preview material intended for printing or for reading
documents online.

<p>

KGhostview is just a front end to <bf/Alladin/'s Ghostcript package which
renders the documents. You can use the viewer with all recent versions of
Ghostscript. Newer versions offer much improved performance which you can
take advantage of with KGhostview. It future, it will be possible to view
Portable Document Format files.

<p>


If a document does not conform to the <bf/Adobe/ document structuring convention
the functionality of the PostScript viewer is limited. If there is no table of
contents, skipping around the document and marking pages is not possible.

<sect>Fundamentals



<p>

This section desribes what you see in the main PostScript viewer window, the
actions of the toolbar buttons and how to use the page list.

You can open multiple PostScript viewer windows to view multiple documents. The
window title bar shows you the name of the document in that window.  The
tools and text fields that help you to navigate a document may be hidden in
order to give more space on the screen to the content area. 

<sect1>Window summary

<p>
<descrip>

	<tag/Window title bar/

	The name of a document is displayed in the window title bar.

	<tag/Page display/

	The content area displays a page of the current document. If the page is
	too large to fit inside the window, scroll bars are automatically added to
	the sides of the display.

	<tag/Tool bar/

	Tool bar buttons activate the PostScript viewer features you'll most commonly
	use. Click on the buttons to move through the document, to change the
	view and to mark and print pages. You can choose to have the toolbar on
	any side of the contents area. Click with the right mouse button on the
	toolbar handle to select the position you want. You can also hide the
	toolbar from the options menu.

	<tag/Status bar /
    
	The status bar has four fields showing the current page, magnification
	factor, orientation and file name of the document. You can choose to hide the
	status bar from the options menu.
	
	<tag/Page list /
	
	A page list can be shown down the left side of the page display. This list
	has three columns: the first may contain a flag indicating that the page
	has been marked; the second shows the page shape; and the third contains
	the page number. You may use this page list to navigate the document or to
	select pages for printing.

<sect1>Info
<p>

Shows the file name, title and creation date of the document.

<sect1>Go to page
<p>

Allows you to select the section and page number of the page you want to
display.

<sect1>Configure key bindings
<p>

Allows you to change the keys that are bound to PostScript viewer actions.

<sect1>Configure interpreter
<p>

The Configure interpreter dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The <bf>General</bf> section.
<item>The <bf>Palette</bf> options.
<item>The <bf>Backing</bf> style.
</enum>

<sect2>General

<p>

One may edit the interpreter name which is by default set to gs suitable for
most systems. One may also check any combination of three options.

<p>

Set <em>Antialiasing</em> for smoothly rendered text. Performing antialiasing
is memory intensive and slower than a straightforward rendering of fonts. If
short of memory or time you may wish to turn this option off. Early versions
of Ghostscript could not perform antialiasing.

<p>

Check <em>Platform fonts</em> if you wish to use your native window system
fonts rather than the fonts that come with your PostScript interpreter.
Recent versions of Ghostscript come with good quality fonts.

<p>

Turn <em>Messages</em> on if you want to be informed of any output or error
messages generated by your PostScript interpreter.

<sect2>Palette
<p>

You may choose the palette to be used to render your PostScript document. The
options are

<itemize>
<item>Color
<item>Grayscale
<item>Monochrome
</itemize>

<sect2>Backing
<p>

You have the choice of two methods to maintain the contents of a page in the
viewer once it has been rendered by your PostScript interpreter. These are

<itemize>
<item>Pixmap
<item>Backing store
</itemize>

One method may be faster on your X server than the other. Also, some X servers do
not offer a backing store.

<sect1>Ghostscript messages
<p>

Displays error or general output messages from Ghostscript.
