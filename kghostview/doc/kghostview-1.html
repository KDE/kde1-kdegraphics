<P>
<P>KGhostview is the PostScript viewer for the K Desktop Environment. It is a
port of Tim Theisen's Ghostview program which is used to view documents
prepared in <B>Adobe</B>'s PostScript page description language. PostScript is
the major page description language for printing on UNIX systems and this
application is used to preview material intended for printing or for reading
documents online.
<P>
<P>
<P>KGhostview is just a front end to <B>Alladin</B>'s Ghostcript package which
renders the documents. You can use the viewer with all recent versions of
Ghostscript. Newer versions offer much improved performance which you can
take advantage of with KGhostview. It future, it will be possible to view
Portable Document Format files.
<P>

<P>
<P>If a document does not conform to the <B>Adobe</B> document structuring convention
the functionality of the PostScript viewer is limited. If there is no table of
contents, skipping around the document and marking pages is not possible.
