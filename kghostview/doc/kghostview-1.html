<P>KGhostview is a port of Tim Theisen's Ghostview program for the K Desktop
Environment. It is used to view documents that have been prepared in
<B>Adobe's</B> PostScript page description language.  Documents are rendered
by  <B>Alladin's</B> Ghostcript package and KGhostview simply displays the
results of this rendering, allowing you to control the way the driver works.</P>


<P>PostScript is <B>the</B> page description language for printing on UNIX systems.
KGhostview can be used to preview material intended for printing or for
reading documents online.</P>


<P>If a document does not begin with the characters &quot;! # PS-Adobe-&quot;, it does not claim conformance to the Adobe document structuring
convention. In this case the functionality of KGhostview is limited - because
there is no table of contents, skipping around the document and marking pages
is not possible.</P>
