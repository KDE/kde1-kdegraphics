<h1>KGhostview</h1>

This is Tim Theisen's Ghostview program ported to the K
Desktop Environment. Ghostview is used to view PostScript
documents on Unix X11 systems. It requires Alladin
Ghostcript to actually perform rendering.

<p>

This version is for demonstration of a method for setting
desktop wide resources in the KDE. It works in conjunction with
Kdisplay-0.5.1.

<h2>Setting fonts, colors and widget styles</h2>

Kdisplay-0.5.1 can set the fonts, colors and widget styles for
Kghostview-0.3.*. This
version isn't really for users. It is still in development. There is nothing
fancy about the communication method - no deamons etc. just XAtoms. What is
being tested here is the possibility of changing fonts etc. in running
programs.

<p>

The verdict ? It works OK but there are some problems with
setPalette() and setStyle() often doesn't change the ComboBox style.

<h2>Keyboard control</h2>

Keybindings so far are
<ul>
<li><b>Prior</b> previous page

<li><b>Next</b>  next page
<li><b>Up arrow</b> scroll up
<li><b>Left arrow</b> scroll left
<li><b>Down arrow</b> scroll down
<li><b>Right arrow</b> scroll right
<li><b>+</b> zoom in
<li><b>-</b> zoom out
<li><b>Ctrl G</b> go to page
<li><b>Ctrl Q</b> quit
</ul>
Of course, these will be configurable in future.

<h2>Office 97 toolbar</h2>

A new type of toolbar is appearing on commercial applications such as Office
97 and Netscape. This toolbar uses "seamless icons" i.e. the raised borders
of traditional buttons are not normally visible. I would like to see these in
the KDE. They offer the best solution to organising many toolbars and
menubars in an application. To demonstrate how they might work Kghostview
has one for this release. ( Not all features implemented. )
