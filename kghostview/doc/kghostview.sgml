<sect>Introduction

<p>

KGhostview is a port of Tim Theisen's Ghostview program for the K Desktop
Environment. It is used to view documents that have been prepared in
<bf/Adobe's/ PostScript page description language.  Documents are rendered
by  <bf/Alladin's/ Ghostcript package and KGhostview simply displays the
results of this rendering, allowing you to control the way the driver works.

<p>

PostScript is <bf/the/ page description language for printing on UNIX systems.
KGhostview can be used to preview material intended for printing or for
reading documents online.

<p>

If the document does not begin with &dquot ! &num PS-Adobe- &dquot , it does not claim conformance
to the document structuring convention. When these documents are encountered,
the functionality of KGhostview is limited to giving you scrollbars and a
next page capability. Because there is no table of contents, skipping around
the document and marking pages is impossible.

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals

<sect1>The KGhostview window

<p>

This section on onscreen fundamentals describes what you see in the main
KGhostview window. The tools and text fields that help you to navigate a
document may be hidden in order to give more space on the screen to the
content area. 

The next section describes a window's graphical elements. The subsequent section
goes into more detail on button actions.

You can open multiple KGhostview windows to view multiple documents. The
window titlebar shows you the name of the document in that window.

	use. Click on the buttons to move through the document, to change the

	Antialiasing is a rendering technique that improves the appearance of
	material to be viewed on low resolution devices like computer monitors.
	Only recent versions of Ghostscript can do antialiasing. It is memory
	intensive and if little memory is available the results are poor.

	Error messages or general output messages from Ghostscript can be
	displayed by KGhostview. Select your preference here.

	<tag/Hide (Show) toolbar/

	Toggle the statusbar on and off.
