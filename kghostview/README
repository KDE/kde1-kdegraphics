KGhostview 0.3.3 - Alpha release

This is Tim Theisen's Ghostview program ported to the K
Desktop Environment. Ghostview is used to view PostScript
documents on Unix X11 systems. It requires Alladin
Ghostcript to actually perform rendering. KGhostview also
uses the Qt toolkit.

This version is for demonstration of a method for setting
desktop wide resources in KDE. It works in conjunction with
Kdisplay-0.5.1.

SETTING FONTS ETC.

Get yourself Kdisplay-0.5.1 if you want to try out setting
fonts and colors for Kghostview-0.3.3. This version isn't really
for users. It is still in development. There is nothing fancy
about the communication method - no daemons etc. just
XAtoms. What is being tested here is the possibility of
changing fonts etc. in running programs.

The verdict ? It works OK but there are some problems with
setPalette()  and setStyle() often doesn't change the
ComboBox style.

I don't feel confident enough to put this in libkde myself.
I would be glad if one of the core programmers would try
it out and adapt it for the library if they think it is up
to the job.

INSTALL

1. Install ktoolpics-0.2

2. Set QTDIR and KDEDIR environment variables
	
	Eg. I use bash shell and type
	
	QTDIR="/usr/lib/qt"; export QTDIR
	KDEDIR="/usr/local/kde"; export KDEDIR
	
3. Have a quick look in the Makefile
4. make
5. make install

If Ghostview works for you then so should KGhostview.
However, all VMS support has been removed and it has only
been tested on Linux. Printer support for SYSV, SVR4 and USG
is missing from this release.
